# Root

This is my (first) take on a digital version of Root.

This version is complete, except, I guess the AI isn't very good ;)

It works, I'm happy with it as a learning exercise, but it's being deprecated while I work on the full version.

## Gameplay

## Installation

Run this command, master is "broken" for playing purposes. It's not broken for transition purposes.

`git clone --single-branch --branch display-backup git@github.com:ayellapragada/root.git`

## Usage

Run `./bin/play FACTION_CODE`

Where the FACTION_CODE is `cats`, `birds`, `mice`, or `racooon`.

## License

The gem is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

## Code of Conduct

Everyone interacting in the root project's codebases, issue trackers, chat rooms and mailing lists is expected to follow the [code of conduct](https://github.com/[USERNAME]/root/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

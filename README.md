# root

This is my take on a digital version of Root.
This gives me a very fun chance to work on a pure ruby project, and object oriented programming.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

Install it yourself as:

    $ gem install root

## Usage

We'll see how it actually "handles"

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies.

Then, run `bundle exec rspec` to run the tests. Run with `COVERAGE=true` to get simplecov going.

You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Useful Links!
[Final PnP of Root](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1i9-iCUDzfGMs7HjFHhahwMS6efvvfX5w) - This is the final one pre release, not 4th printing., useful to reference. Not perfect.


[Components List](https://geekdad.com/2018/11/reaping-the-rewards-geekdad-digs-root/) - It's a review but it also has a list of components.

## Ideas For Next

- Refactor code and tests to Daylight() type structure for everyone.

# Root

This is my take on a digital version of Root.

This version is relatively complete, but the AI isn't that great.

It works, I'm happy with it as a learning exercise, but it's not supported / nor was it ever really supported.

Stay tuned for more info on my next related project!

## Gameplay

![Full Game Screen](./screenshots/full.png)

It's a full game run through, you start the game, it'll show you relevant information on each of the factions.

Whatever their game boards would normally display.

The Cats for example, show how many more buildings they have on their track, the Birds have their decree.

After that it'll take you through a guided through version of the game, you'll see all your available actions, can cancel actions, use cards, the whole jingle jangle.

## The Why

![Look at all that code coverage](./screenshots/test_cov.png)

This was honestly just me wanting to build out a slightly more complex project that was in a different vein than a normal web app.

It was really fun building something that was more of a long runnng process, and building out a complicated system.

All while keeping the entire thing at 100% code coverage, and 100% branch coverage.

A commit never went below 99% code coverage. Or you know, rarely did. Don't hold me to this.

Does that mean the tests are good and cover everything? No :)

## Installation

Master has been reverted :) so this should work as is now.

Git clone the repo, go into the repo. You'll need Ruby.

## Usage

Run `./bin/play FACTION_CODE`

Where the FACTION_CODE is `cats`, `birds`, `mice`, or `racooon`.
